# Analyzing borrowersâ€™ risk of defaulting

In this project I will analyze the risk that a customer of a bank will default on a loan. The report will assist the loans devision of the bank in creating the credit scores of new potential customers, which are used to evaluate a borrower's ability to repay loans.

I will focus on finding the effect of the following parameters of the borrower on the defaulting probability:

- Number of children
- Income level
- Loan purpose
- Family status

To reach the conclusions, I will use existing data that was collected by the bank on the credit worthiness of its customers.
